# Google Software Product Sprint

This repo contains Deepti Vaidyanathan's portfolio and SPS projects. 

A little bit about me:
* I am a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Information/Internetworks
* I am currently really interested in adversarial machine learning and how it ties in with other information security principles.
* I am including all of these facts mainly because I want to learn how to use Markdown for other things besides text.
